        <p>
            Dear Amyra Natasha, my pretty little amazing angel of a girlfriend,  <br>
            On your special day, 27th of December of every year, I just want to say how much you mean to me. 
            You bring so much happiness, love, and light into my life. 
            I am beyond grateful for every moment we have shared, and I am so lucky to have you by my side. 
            I know having me as your boyfriend has made your life a rollercoaster of emotions. 
            But I hope you know that the 2 year relationship I have with you is one of the best thing that have happened to me.
            You are my everything, and I am sorry for all the wrongs that I've caused. 
            All the lies that I've told,
            All the flowers I never buy, 
            All the shouts that hurts you,
            and All the sleepless nights I've caused. I am genuinely sorry. 
            If there was an award for being the best human being on Earth, you would have won it,
            You would have won it as you're so kind, amazing, hardworking, You're just special. 
            Thank you for being my girlfriend, and giving me a second chance in US. 
            You deserve everything sayang,
            and I will try my best to give you that everything.
            To more days with you baby,
            Happy Birthday! ðŸ’–
        </p>
